                                            My ambition is to take Art life company to the top in Indian Market because this belief has been made 
                                            strong by the feedback given by our users and distributors about the positive influence of Art life
                                            products on general health . When we started our business in India then we were working only with 
                                            6 products and today we have more than 40 products and all the products are excellent. Our Head
                                            office in Russia has been working with so many new concepts, new products, new internet system
                                            and in near future we will be providing so many facilities for our Indian distributors that
                                            they will have an easy access to all the information. Today we are working in Assam , Chattisgarh,
                                            Nagaland , U.P, Punjab ,Delhi , Rajasthan ,Gujarat ,Goa ,Mumbai, M .P , Kerala, Hyderabad
                                            and many other places as well. My 1st priority is to build a strong base of education 
                                            system so that people get good knowledge about our products, marketing plan & system 
                                            of our Company. My 2nd priority is to provide easy delivery of products to all our 
                                            distributors, for which I am developing new Service centers and also trying to open up new 
                                            offices in India. Just a few months back, Art life Company has opened a new office in Mumbai 
                                            as well. We are also developing informative materials, product catalogues, CDs and soon we 
                                            will launch our new website in India, where people will get a lot of information.<br>

                                            Dreams won't come looking for you, that's why you have to chase them, pursue them until they become reality and then hold on tightly.
                                                <!--As a Director it is my responsibility to build an environment where employees can flourish by enabling involvement at every level. I conduct a lot of open house sessions to talk to my Distributors directly. This also gives me an opportunity to understand their needs and concerns better. I love to work with our Distributors as I am always planning new promotions for them and developing new promotional materials using innovative ideas. I always talk to them and try to understand their problems and welcome their new ideas/suggestions for improving the Business.
